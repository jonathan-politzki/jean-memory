# JEAN Project Status

## Current Functionality
- ✅ **Frontend UI**: Modern AI-style interface with responsive design
- ✅ **Authentication**: Google OAuth integration working properly
- ✅ **CORS & API Communication**: Frontend-backend communication properly configured
- ✅ **MCP Endpoint**: Basic Model Context Protocol implementation for retrieve/store
- ✅ **Context Router**: Structure for routing different context types
- ✅ **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL connection and schema established
- ✅ **Note Storage**: Notes can be created and stored in the database
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Development mode with fallbacks for API validation

## Working Flow
1. Frontend server (port 3005) serves the user interface
2. Backend server (port 8080) provides API endpoints including MCP
3. User logs in with Google OAuth
4. Backend authenticates and redirects to frontend with user credentials
5. Dashboard shows MCP config and available context sources
6. Notes can be created and stored in the PostgreSQL database

## Architecture Improvements
- ✅ **Database Singleton Pattern**: Ensures all app components use the same database connection
- ✅ **API Key Validation**: Robust validation with development mode fallbacks
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling and logging throughout the application

## Next Steps

### 1. Enhance Context Functionality
- Implement note retrieval UI
- Start with GitHub integration
- Add vector embeddings for improved context search

### 2. Full MCP Compliance
- Adapt to official MCP SDK
- Add support for both stdio and HTTP transports
- Implement proper prompt templates

### 3. Security & Production Readiness
- Remove development mode fallbacks for production
- Implement proper API key rotation
- Add rate limiting and additional security measures

## How to Run

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
# Update .env with correct settings
python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8080
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
node server.js
# Go to http://localhost:3005
```

## Authentication Flow
The application now supports Google authentication with proper API key handling. After authentication, users can create and store notes that persist in the database.

## Development Mode
For testing during development, the application includes fallbacks that allow:
- Any API key to be accepted (mapped to user_id=1)
- Automatic creation of test users if needed
- Detailed logging for debugging authentication issues
