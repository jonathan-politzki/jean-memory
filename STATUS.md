# JEAN Project Status

## Current Functionality
- ✅ **Frontend UI**: Modern AI-style interface with responsive design
- ✅ **Authentication**: Google OAuth integration working properly, including correct parameter passing to frontend.
- ✅ **CORS & API Communication**: Frontend-backend communication properly configured
- ✅ **Containerization**: Full application (frontend, backend, postgres, redis) successfully containerized with Docker Compose for consistent builds and execution.
- ✅ **MCP Endpoint**: Basic Model Context Protocol implementation for retrieve/store
- ✅ **Context Router**: Structure for routing different context types
- ✅ **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL connection and schema established
- ✅ **Note Storage**: Notes can be created and stored in the database
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Development mode with fallbacks for API validation

## Working Flow
1. Run `docker-compose up` to start all services.
2. Frontend server (port 3005) serves the user interface from its container.
3. Backend server (port 8000 on host, internally 8000) provides API endpoints from its container.
4. User logs in with Google OAuth.
5. Backend authenticates and redirects to frontend with correct user credentials in URL.
6. Dashboard shows MCP config and available context sources.
7. Notes can be created and stored in the PostgreSQL database

## Architecture Improvements
- ✅ **Database Singleton Pattern**: Ensures all app components use the same database connection
- ✅ **API Key Validation**: Robust validation with development mode fallbacks
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling and logging throughout the application

## Next Steps

### 1. Enhance Context Functionality
- Implement note retrieval UI
- Start with GitHub integration
- Add vector embeddings for improved context search

### 2. Full MCP Compliance
- Adapt to official MCP SDK
- Add support for both stdio and HTTP transports
- Implement proper prompt templates

### 3. Security & Production Readiness
- Remove development mode fallbacks for production
- Implement proper API key rotation
- Add rate limiting and additional security measures

## How to Run

### Backend
```bash
# Now run via Docker Compose
# cd backend
# # Update .env with correct settings
# python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8080
docker-compose up # (handles backend)
```

### Frontend
```bash
# Now run via Docker Compose
# cd frontend
# node server.js
# # Go to http://localhost:3005
docker-compose up # (handles frontend, go to http://localhost:3005)
```

## Authentication Flow
The application now supports Google authentication with proper API key handling. After authentication, user ID and API key are correctly passed to the frontend, and users can create and store notes that persist in the database. All services run via Docker Compose.

## Development Mode
For testing during development, the application includes fallbacks that allow:
- Any API key to be accepted (mapped to user_id=1)
- Automatic creation of test users if needed
- Detailed logging for debugging authentication issues
