# JEAN Project Status

## Current Functionality
- ✅ **Frontend UI**: Modern AI-style interface with responsive design
- ✅ **Authentication**: Google OAuth integration working properly, including correct parameter passing to frontend.
- ✅ **CORS & API Communication**: Frontend-backend communication properly configured
- ✅ **Containerization**: Full application (frontend, backend, postgres, redis) successfully containerized with Docker Compose for consistent builds and execution.
- ✅ **MCP Endpoint**: Full Model Context Protocol implementation with SDK, tools, and resources
- ✅ **Context Router**: Structure for routing different context types
- ✅ **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL connection and schema established
- ✅ **Note Storage**: Notes can be created and stored in the database
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Development mode with fallbacks for API validation

## Working Flow
1. Run `docker-compose up` to start all services.
2. Frontend server (port 3005) serves the user interface from its container.
3. Backend server (port 8000 on host, internally 8000) provides API endpoints from its container.
4. User logs in with Google OAuth.
5. Backend authenticates and redirects to frontend with correct user credentials in URL.
6. MCP configuration page shows Claude Desktop and IDE integration settings.
7. Notes can be created and stored in the PostgreSQL database
8. MCP server enables AI assistants to directly access user data through standardized protocol

## Architecture Improvements
- ✅ **Database Singleton Pattern**: Ensures all app components use the same database connection
- ✅ **API Key Validation**: Robust validation with development mode fallbacks
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling and logging throughout the application
- ✅ **MCP Integration**: Full Model Context Protocol implementation with proper tools and resources

## Next Steps

### 1. Enhance Context Functionality
- Implement note retrieval UI
- Start with GitHub integration
- Add vector embeddings for improved context search

### 2. Full MCP Compliance
- ✅ Implement using official MCP SDK
- ✅ Add support for HTTP transport
- ✅ Implement proper authentication
- ✅ Support for MCP tools, resources, and prompts

### 3. Security & Production Readiness
- Remove development mode fallbacks for production
- Implement proper API key rotation
- Add rate limiting and additional security measures

## How to Run

### Backend
```bash
# Now run via Docker Compose
# cd backend
# # Update .env with correct settings
# python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8080
docker-compose up # (handles backend)
```

### Frontend
```bash
# Now run via Docker Compose
# cd frontend
# node server.js
# # Go to http://localhost:3005
docker-compose up # (handles frontend, go to http://localhost:3005)
```

## Authentication Flow
The application now supports Google authentication with proper API key handling. After authentication, user ID and API key are correctly passed to the frontend, and users can create and store notes that persist in the database. All services run via Docker Compose.

## MCP Integration
JEAN is now an "MCP first" application, implementing the full Model Context Protocol as defined by Anthropic. This allows seamless integration with Claude Desktop and IDE extensions like Cursor and VS Code. Users can:

1. Authenticate with Google OAuth
2. Receive personalized MCP configuration for their Claude Desktop and IDE extension
3. Use AI assistants to access and manage their personal memory data
4. Store and retrieve notes, GitHub data, and other context through standardized MCP tools and resources

The MCP implementation provides:
- Tool endpoints for note creation, search, and retrieval
- GitHub integration for repositories and code search
- Configuration resources for easy setup
- Authentication middleware for secure access
- Full SDK implementation based on official Anthropic specifications

## Development Mode
For testing during development, the application includes fallbacks that allow:
- Any API key to be accepted (mapped to user_id=1)
- Automatic creation of test users if needed
- Detailed logging for debugging authentication issues
