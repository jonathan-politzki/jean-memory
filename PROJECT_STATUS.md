# JEAN Memory Project Status

## Project Overview

JEAN (JSON Entity Aware Network) Memory is a personal AI memory layer that enhances AI assistants with contextual information. The system provides an interface for storing and retrieving user data and exposing it to AI assistants through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Core Components Implemented

- **Backend API**: FastAPI-based service with PostgreSQL database for storing user context
- **Frontend UI**: Modern, responsive web interface for user interaction
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth integration for secure user access
- **Context Storage**: System for storing and retrieving notes and other user data
- **Docker Integration**: Full containerization with docker-compose for consistent deployment
- **Basic MCP Structure**: Initial Model Context Protocol integration framework

### ðŸ”„ MCP Implementation Progress

We've made significant progress implementing the Model Context Protocol:

1. **Jean MCP Module**: Created a clean, structured implementation in `jean_mcp/` that follows the official MCP SDK patterns:
   - `jean_mcp/server/mcp_server.py`: Server configuration with lifespan management
   - `jean_mcp/server/middleware.py`: Authentication middleware for MCP requests
   - `jean_mcp/tools/note_tools.py`: Tools for creating, searching, and retrieving notes
   - `jean_mcp/tools/github_tools.py`: Tools for GitHub integration (stub implementation)
   - `jean_mcp/tools/auth_tools.py`: Tools for authentication and configuration

2. **MCP Server Integration**: Mounted the MCP server at `/mcp` in the main FastAPI application

3. **Configuration Page**: Added `mcp-config.html` to provide Claude Desktop and IDE integration settings

## Technical Details

### MCP Implementation Architecture

- We're using the official MCP SDK from Anthropic (`mcp` package v1.6.0+)
- Implemented through Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport at `/mcp` endpoint
- Authentication through X-API-Key header and middleware validation
- Providing resources, tools, and context data through standardized MCP interfaces
- Structured to handle multiple users and tenants

### What We Know Works

- The core application (backend and frontend) functions correctly with proper Docker setup
- The MCP endpoint is properly configured and mounted in the FastAPI application
- Authentication middleware is correctly validating API keys
- The MCP implementation responds correctly to invalid requests (rejecting them as expected)

### Current Challenges

1. **Testing the MCP Endpoint**: 
   - Standard HTTP tools like curl aren't suitable for testing MCP due to its stateful nature
   - MCP requires a full session lifecycle (initialize â†’ initialized â†’ method calls)
   - Need proper MCP client tools for testing

2. **Client Configuration**:
   - While configuration template is generated, proper endpoint URL structure needs verification
   - Need to ensure Claude Desktop can successfully connect to our MCP server

## Next Steps

1. **Proper MCP Testing**:
   - Use `mcp dev` command to test the server implementation
   - Create a test client using the MCP client libraries
   - Verify tool and resource availability through MCP Inspector

2. **Endpoint Configuration**:
   - Finalize the proper Claude Desktop configuration
   - Ensure the SSE transport is correctly supported at the `/mcp` endpoint

3. **Documentation**:
   - Document the MCP tools and resources available
   - Create examples of client integrations

4. **Enhanced MCP Features**:
   - Implement additional context types beyond notes
   - Add more robust error handling for MCP requests
   - Support additional MCP transport options if needed

## Technical Notes

### Claude Desktop Configuration

The correct configuration for Claude Desktop integration should be:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jean-memory": {
      "serverType": "HTTP",
      "serverUrl": "http://localhost:8000/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "X-API-Key": "your-api-key",
        "X-User-ID": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### MCP Protocol Notes

1. The MCP protocol follows JSON-RPC 2.0 standard
2. Requires a stateful connection (not just individual HTTP requests)
3. Supports both Server-Sent Events (SSE) and standard I/O (stdio) transports
4. Tools, resources, and prompts must exactly match the URI template pattern
5. Context parameters in MCP functions must not conflict with URI parameters
